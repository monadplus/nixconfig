## Pending configurations for nixOS

[X] Power Management, suspend laptop and battery info
[ ] Wi-fi: for home and interactive with public wi-fi
[ ] Bluetooth headphones ? Good luck
[ ] Screenlight and redshift
[ ] Xmonad + Xmobar: first iteration doesn't have to be shinny, only usable.
[ ] A terminal emulator managed by config files (konsole is bad at this)
